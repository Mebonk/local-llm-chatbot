# local-llm-chatbot
This project is a simple command-line chatbot built in Python using Ollama and the LLaMA 3 model.
It demonstrates how to integrate a local large language model (LLM) into a Python application without using external APIs.

The goal of this project is to explore:

Local LLM execution

Python-to-LLM interaction

Prompt-based text generation

Lightweight AI tool development
